## Introduction

Welcome to my blog! Hi, this is Yifan Kang, or you might also know me as **ETK** in coding competitions. I am currently a senior at Phillips Academy.

## Passions

I enjoy studying math, physics, and CS. I am a competitive programmer that attends contest like USACO, codeforces, atcoder, etc. I am also interested in solving math and physics olympiad problems. Other than STEM, I love running, singing, and playing the tuba.
