An interesting question that mathematicians are curious about is the maximum number of edges in a n-vertex graph $G$ that forbids some other graph $H$. In other words, $G$ cannot contain $H$ as a subgraph.

### Mantel's Theorem

We may also start from the simplest question, **what is the maximum number of edges in a n-vertex graph without any triangle?** This is a foundational problem in extremal graph theory, where people study how the global properties of a graph influence local substructure.

> Hint: Try solving the case when $n=3,4,5$. Do you see any pattern?

*(Mantel's Theorem):* $K_{\lfloor n/2\rfloor,\lceil n/2\rceil}$ has the most number of edges among all triangle-free graphs. So every $n$-vertex triangle-free graph has at most $\lfloor n^2/4\rfloor$ edges.

We will give two different proofs of Mantel's theorem and each illustrates a different technique in combinatorics. The proof requires some knowledge of [Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy%E2%80%93Schwarz_inequality), which states that for any two list of real numbers $a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n$ and $b_1,b_2,\dots,b_n$, we have:


$$
(a_1^2+a_2^2+\cdots+a_n^2)(b_1^2+b_2^2+\cdots+b_n^2)\ge(a_1b_1+a_2b_2+\cdots+a_nb_n)^2
$$

It has many proofs but I will not show them here since it's unrelated to our topics. Feel free to read one of my previous blog post on [Olympiad Inequalities](https://yifank.github.io/Math/Olympiad%20Inequalities/), in which I discuss more about these inequalities.

*First Proof of Mantel's Theorem:* Let $G=(V,E)$ be a triangle-free graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. For any edge $(x,y)$ in the graph, by the triangle-free condition, $x$ and $y$ don't have common neighbors, otherwise suppose $z$ is the neighbor of $x$ and $y$, $x,y,z$ will form a triangle.

![Mantel's theorem 1.png](https://github.com/YIFANK/YIFANK.github.io/blob/main/pics/Mantel's%20theorem%201.png?raw=true) 

Thus, we have $\deg x + \deg y\le n$. Go through all the edges of $G$ and sum this up, we get:
$$
\sum_{(x,y)\in E}(\deg x + \deg y)\le \sum_{(x,y)\in E}n=mn
$$


On the other hand, for each vertex $x$, the term $\deg x$ appears for every edge $(x,y)$ in $E$ in the above inequality. Thus, in total $\deg x$ appears $\deg x$ times:



$$\sum_{(x,y)\in E}(\deg x + \deg y)=\sum_{x\in V}(\deg x)^2\le mn$$



However, by Cauchy-Schwarz inequality we can also get: 



$$
n\sum_{x\in V}(\deg x) ^2 =(1+1+\cdots + 1)\sum_{x\in V}(\deg x) ^2\ge (\sum_{x\in V}\deg x)^2=(2m)^2
$$


Combine the above two inequalities,


$$
(2m)^2/n\le mn\implies m\le n^2/4
$$


as desired.

*Second Proof of Mantel's Theorem:* Let $v$ be a vertex of maximum degree in the graph $G$. For any $x,y$ in the neighborhood $N(v)$ of $v$, $x$ and $y$ are not adjacent by the triangle-free condition.

Let $A=N(v),B=V\setminus A$. All the edges in $G$ have an endpoint in $B$ (because the two vertices of the edge cannot be both in $A$). By this relation, we have the following inequality:


$$
m\le \sum_{x\in B}\deg x\le |B|\max_{x\in V}\deg x \le |B||N(v)|\le (\dfrac{|A|+|B|}{2})^2= \dfrac{n^2}{4}
$$


where the last $\le$ sign is derived by AM-GM inequality.

> Exercise: Can you prove Mantel's theorem by induction?

*Proof:* I will show the induction proof when $n$ is even, so $n=2k$. The odd case works similarly and is left to the readers.

When $k=1$, every graph with two vertices has at most $1$ edge so the claim holds.

For $k > 1$, we can pick an edge $(x,y)$ in the graph and let $G'$ denote the subgraph using the other vertices. 

- if $G'$ has more than $(k-1)^2$ edges, then $G'$ is not triangle-free by induction.

- Otherwise, for any vertex $v$ in $G'$, we cannot have $(x,v)$ and $(y,v)$ both in our graph by triangle-free condition. So the total number of edges in $G$ is at most 

	

	$$(k-1)^2+2(k-1)+1=k^2-2k+1+2k-2+1=k^2$$

	

Thus the claim holds for all even $n$.

*Exercise:* Prove that a graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges has at least


$$
\dfrac{4m}{3n}(m-\dfrac{n^2}{4})\quad\text{triangles}
$$

*Hint:* We can count the number of triangles by the same method as what we did in the first proof.

*Proof:* The number of triangles with the edge $(x,y)$ is at least $\deg x + \deg y - n$. If we count this way, every triangle is counted three times since it has three edges. Thus, the lower bound of the number of triangles is:


$$
\frac 13\sum_{(x,y)\in E}(\deg x + \deg y-n)=\frac13\bigg(\sum_{x\in V}(\deg x)^2-mn\bigg)
$$


Apply Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and we get:


$$
\frac13\bigg(\sum_{x\in V}(\deg x)^2-mn\bigg)\ge \frac{1}{3n}\bigg(\sum_{x\in V}\deg x\bigg)^2-\frac{mn}{3}=\frac{4m^2}{3n}-\frac{mn}{3}=\frac{4m}{3n}(m-\frac{n^2}{4})
$$



### Turán's Theorem

*Turán's theorem* is the generalization of *Mantel's theorem* from triangles to larger cliques. It provides the answer to this question:

> *What is the maximum number of edges in a $K_{r+1}$-free graph on $n$ vertices?*

Note that for $r=2$ our answer is Mantel's theorem and the graph we have is a bipartite graph with two parts with sizes as close as possible. It feels natural for us to hypothesize that:

We call the complete $r$-partite graph with its $n$ vertices distributed among its $r$ parts as evenly as possible $T_{n,r}$, also known as the *Turán's graph*. More formally, for $n = ra+b,0\le b<r$, and $a,b$ are integers, we have $b$ parts with size $a+1$ and $r-b$ parts with size $a$ in $T_{n,r}$. Below is an example of $T_{13,4}$:

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Turan_13-4.svg" alt="Turán graph - Wikipedia" style="zoom:50%;" />

*Turán's theorem:* The Turan's graph $T_{n,r}$ is the unique $n$-vertex graph that maximizes the number of edges among all $K_{r+1}$-free graphs. 

*Exercise:* Assume that we have proven *Turán's theorem*. Prove that


$$
e(T_{n,r})\le(1-\dfrac1r)\dfrac{n^2}2
$$



where $e(G)$ denotes the number of edges in a graph $G$ and we have equality if and only if $n$ is divisible by $r$.

*Hint:* We can use AM-GM to prove this, notice that $n$ won't be divided in $r$ equal parts when $n$ is not divisible by $r$.

*Lemma:* $T_{n,r}$ is the unique $n$-vertex $r$-partite graph with the maximum number of edges.

*Hint 1:* We can prove by contradiction! Let's say we have a $n$-vertex $r$-partite graph with the maximum number of edges that is not $T_{n,r}$, how can we adjust it to increase the number of edges?

*Hint 2:* For $b-a\ge 2$, we have


$$
(a+1)(b-1)=ab+(b-a-1)>ab
$$


*Proof:* Suppose we have a $n$-vertex $r$-partite graph with the maximum number of edges. Then it should be a complete $r$-partite graph, otherwise we can add edges between its different parts.

For any two vertex parts $A$ and $B$, if $|B|-|A|\ge 2$ we can apply the inequality in the previous hint and see it's better to move an vertex of $B$ to $A$. Thus, all $r$ parts must have sizes within one of each other.

There are also many proofs for *Turán's theorem*. We will focus on a proof that is extended from our previous proof of *Mantel's theorem*. **Mathematical induction** plays an important role in this proof and other proofs!

*First proof of Turán's theorem:* We prove by induction on $r$. When $r=1$, this is trivial since a $K_2$-free graph is empty. Now assume that the theorem holds for every $n$ for $r-1$.

<img src="https://github.com/YIFANK/YIFANK.github.io/blob/main/pics/Turan%201.png?raw=true" alt="Turan 1.png" style="zoom:50%;" />

Let $G$ be a $K_{r+1}$-free graph and $v$ a vertex of maximum degree in $G$. The neighborhood of $v$ $A=N(v)$ is $K_r$-free. By induction, we know that


$$
e(A)\le e(T_{|A|,r-1})
$$


Let $B=V\setminus A$. Since $v$ is a vertex of maximum degree, we have $\deg x\le \deg v = |A|$ for all $x\in V$. The number of edges with at least one vertex in $B$ is:


$$
e(A,B) + e(B)\le \sum_{x\in B}\deg x \le |B|\max_{x\in B}\deg x\le |A||B|
$$


Thus


$$
e(G)=e(A) + e(A,B) + e(B)\le e(T_{|A|,r-1}) + |A||B|\le e(T_{n,r})
$$

the final equality follows from that $e(T_{|A|,r-1}) + |A||B|$ is the number of edges in a $r$-partite graph with $n$ vertices and our previous lemma.

What we are curious about in this chapter is generally how big an $n$-vertex $H$-free graph $G$ can be. Thus, we develop a notation $ex(n,H)$ as the maximum number of edges in $G$. We are curious about how $ex(n,H)$ grows as $n\to \infty$, which leads to extremal graph theory.

### Problems

Every graph $G$ with average degree $d$ contains a subgraph $H$ such that all vertices of $H$ has degrees at least $d/2$.

*Hint:* Delete the vertices with degree less than $d/2$ until the graph meets our condition. Why does this guarantee a solution?

Prove *Turán's theorem* by induction on $n$.

*Hint:* For an $n$-vertex $K_{r+1}$-free graph $G$ with the maximum number of edges, $G$ contains $K_r$ as a subgraph. Let $A$ be the vertex set of a $K_r$ in $G$ and $B=V\setminus A$.

*(KST Theorem)* For positive integers $s\le t$, there exist some constant $C$ such that for all $n$:

$$
ex(n,K_{s,t})\le Cn^{2-1/s}
$$


*Hint:* Let $X$ be the number of $K_{s,1}$ in $G$. Count $X$ in two different ways to show that:


$$
X=\sum_{x\in V}\binom{\deg x}{s}\le \binom{n}{s}(t-1)
$$


*(IMO 1992/3):* Consider $9$ points in space, no four of which are coplanar. Each pair of points is joined by an edge (that is, a line segment) and each edge is either colored blue or red or left uncolored. Find the smallest value of $n$ such that whenever exactly $n$ edges are colored, the set of colored edges necessarily contains a triangle all of whose edges have the same color.

*Hint 1:* Rephrase it in the language of graph theory and make connections to the theorems we have learned.

*Hint 2:* Apply *Turán's Theorem* and Ramsey's number $R(3,3)=6$.

Let $T$ be a tree with $t$ edges. Prove that every graph $G$ with average degree at least $2t$ contains $t$ as a subgraph.
