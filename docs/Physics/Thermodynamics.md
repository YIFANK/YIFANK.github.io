### The Ideal Gas Law

$$
pV=nRT=Nk_BT,p=\dfrac{\rho k_BT}{m}
$$

where:

- $p$ is the absolute pressure of the gas,
- $V$ is the volume of the gas,
- $n$ is the number of moles,
- $R$ is the ideal gas constant,
- $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant,
- $N_A$ is the Avogadro constant,
- $T$ is the absolute temperature of the gas,
- $N$ is the number of particles.

### The First Law of Thermodynamics

$$
dU= dW +dQ,dW=-PdV
$$

### The Second Law of Thermodynamics 

$$
dS=\dfrac{dQ}{T}
$$
