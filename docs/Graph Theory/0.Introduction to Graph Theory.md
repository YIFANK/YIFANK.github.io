From now on, I will be creating a series of blog posts as well as presentations on graph theory. The blog post is inspired by Prof. Yufei Zhao's book Graph Theory and Additive Combinatorics. I will be discussing selected topics and problems in this book as well as providing solutions to some exercises.

So, what is graph theory?

I am bad at explaining things, so I asked chatGPT for its definition:

> ChatGPT: "Graph theory is a branch of mathematics that studies the properties and structures of graphs, which are mathematical representations of networks of objects or relationships between them. Graphs can be used to model a wide range of problems in various fields, including computer science, engineering, social sciences, biology, physics, and more. Some of the basic concepts in graph theory include vertices (or nodes), edges, and various types of graph such as directed, undirected, weighted and unweighted."

First, we introduce some notations to define a graph.

We write a graph as $G=(V,E)$, where $V$ is the set of vertices and $E\subseteq \{(x,y)|x,y\in V\}$ is the set of edges. When there's a direction for the edges (e.g. $x\to y$), we say the graph is **directed**, otherwise it's **undirected**. We will focus on undirected graphs in our future posts. 

For example, when $V=\{1,2,3,4\},E=\{(1,3),(1,4),(2,3),(2,4)\}$. The graph looks like this:

This is also known as a $K_{2,2}$ graph, which means we have two vertices on the left and other two on the right, and every vertex on the left is connected with every vertex on the right.

Generally, we define **the complete bipartite graph** $K_{s,t}$ to be a graph with $s$ vertices in one part and $t$ on the other, and any edges in between the two parts are connected.

Moreover, $K_r$ is the **complete graph** on $r$ vertices, which means $E=\{(x,y)|1\le x < y\le r \}$ . It is also known as a **$r$-clique**.

In a graph $G=(V,E)$, we say two vertices $u$ and $v$ are **neighbors** or **adjacent** if there exist an edge $(u,v)\in E$ . In the above example, $1$ is a neighbor of $4$ but not a neighbor of $2$. 

A **neighborhood** of $u$ is defined as the set of all $u$'s neighbors. Formally, $N(u)=\{v|(u,v)\in E\}$. In the above example, $1$'s neighborhood contains $3$ and $4$, so $N(1)=\{3,4\}$.

The **degree** of $v$ is the number of edges that contains $v$, denoted as $\deg v$ . In undirected graphs without self-loops (weird edges like $(u,u)$), it's clear that $\deg v = |N(v)|$.

*Claim:* For a graph with $m$ edges, we have


$$
\sum_v \deg v  = 2m
$$


*Proof:* For each edge $(u,v)$, we count it twice on the left hand side (in $\deg u$ and $\deg v$), thus it sums up to $2m$.

*Handshaking Lemma:* In a undirected graph, the number of vertices with **odd** degree is **even**.

The name of this theorem comes from a famous mathematical problem, which is proving that: in a party, the number of people who shake hands an **odd** number of times must be **even**.

*Proof:* Assume that that number is odd, then for the left hand side you get $1\times 1 + 0\equiv 1\pmod 2$ (odd times odd + even = odd). However, the right hand side is even. Contradiction! Thus the statement holds.
